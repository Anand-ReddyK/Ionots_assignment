# Ionots - Project Assignment and Progress Tracking System

The goal of the project was to develop a backend system to manage project assignments, track progress, and calculate scores based on task completion. This system allows candidates to view, accept, and track their assigned projects in real time.

## 1. Project Assignment
### Backend:
- Created models for projects and tasks, where each project is assigned to a user.
- Implemented the ability to view, accept, and track the status of projects.
- The project statuses include "Pending", "Accepted", and "Completed".
- Users can see detailed project descriptions, deadlines, and their current status.

### Frontend:
- Designed user-friendly pages using Tailwind CSS to display projects with their details.
- Added functionality to accept or view project details, with a clear status indicator.

### The Projects Page

## 2. Progress Tracking and Scoring System
### Backend:

- Implemented a system to track the progress of a project based on the completion of its tasks.
- Each task has a "Completed" or "Pending" status, and when all tasks are completed, the project status is updated to "Completed".
- The progress percentage is dynamically calculated and displayed on the frontend.
- Added a scoring mechanism based on task completion to track performance.

### Frontend:

- Displayed project progress with a percentage bar showing the completion status of tasks.
- Used conditional styling to show completed tasks in green.
- Displayed total score and the score obtained based on completed tasks.

## Future Improvements:
- **Task Deadlines:** Add deadlines for individual tasks to further enhance project management.
- **Role-based Access Control:** Implement permissions to ensure that only authorized users can create new projects. This will help maintain control over who has the ability to initiate projects within the system.
- **Ownership-based Task Management:** Restrict task creation to the user who initially created the project. This ensures that only the project owner can manage and add tasks, preserving the integrity of the projectâ€™s structure and tasks.
